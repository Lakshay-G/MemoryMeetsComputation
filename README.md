# MemoryMeetsComputation

This repository consists of all the code required by the paper []. This paper provides a compehensive study for sentiment analysis for psychology data. Currently we are comparing existing methods of VADER and TextBlob for two different datasets. Briefly, we're doing 4 things: (a) sentiment analysis (b) metrics for the sentiment analysis (c) wordcloud generation (d) top word counts; in this code.

## Getting Started

## Installation

    1. Clone this repository using
    `git clone https://github.com/Lakshay-G/MemoryMeetsComputation.git`
    2. Install the required Python libraries using
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    3. Download **snowball stopwords list** from [Link Text] (https://github.com/quanteda/stopwords/blob/master/data/data_stopwords_snowball.rda)

## Usage

    1. Since [Link Text] (https://github.com/quanteda/stopwords/blob/master/data/data_stopwords_snowball.rda) is an *R* object, we need to extract the stopwords list for using it in *Python*.
